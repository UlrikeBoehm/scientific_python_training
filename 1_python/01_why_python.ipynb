    "**It's Free**\n",
    "Python is both free and open-source. The Python Software Foundation distributes pre-made binaries that are freely available for use on all major operating systems called `CPython`. You can get CPython's source-code, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-Level Language**\n",
    "Python looks more like a readable, human language than like a low-level language. This gives you the ability to program at a faster rate than a low-level language will allow you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-platform**\n",
    "Python runs on all major operating systems like Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS X. A version called [`micropython`](https://micropython.org/) also can run on microcontrollers, small single-board computers like the arduino and Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy installation**\n",
    "Python, and many of its most popular packages, especially for data science, are easily installable with the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**It's Safe**\n",
    "Python doesn't have pointers like other C-based languages, making it much more reliable. Along with that, errors never pass silently unless they're explicitly silenced. This allows you to see and read why the program crashed and where to correct your error."

    "**Easy Syntax**\n",
    "Python's syntax is easy to learn, so both non-programmers and programmers can start programming right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Readability**\n",
    "Python's syntax is very clear, so it is easy to understand program code. Python is often referred to as \"executable pseudo-code\" because its syntax mostly follows the conventions used by programmers to outline their ideas without the formal verbosity of code in most programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Purpose Language**\n",
    "Python has data strucutres and functions that all modern high level langugaes have, like dictionaries for key - value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batteries Included**\n",
    "Python is famous for being the \"batteries are included\" language. There are over 300 standard library modules which contain modules and classes for a wide variety of programming tasks."

Programming languages usually define objects with namespaces, like class or def, and objects can edit themselves by using keyword, like this or self.\n",
